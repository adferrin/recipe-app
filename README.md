# Recipe Web App with user generated recipes

I created this web app for creating and storing recipes that have been tested and found to be without errors.

# Getting Started 

<a href="https://recipe-app-adf.herokuapp.com/">Click here</a> to get started

# Future Enhancements 
- I would like to be able to add the ability to upload photos from the users creating their recipes
- Once more photos have been uploaded I would add carousel for displaying all the photos in the main page instead of just a list of recipes 
- Adding the ability to search by ingredients
